# Step-by-step Filtering Recommendation Algorithm

Given the datasets you have, we can proceed with building a collaborative filtering recommendation system using the available data. Here's a plan for how to approach this:
Step-by-Step Plan
Data Preparation:

Load the data into DataFrames.
Merge the DataFrames where necessary to get a complete view of the data.
Handle any missing values or inconsistencies in the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand the distribution of ratings.
Analyze the tag data to understand how tags are distributed across books.
Explore the to-read data to see how it correlates with the ratings data.
Collaborative Filtering:

Create a user-item matrix from the ratings data.
Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) to generate recommendations.
Evaluation:

Split the data into training and test sets.
Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Generate Recommendations:

Use the trained model to generate book recommendations for users.
Let's start by loading and preparing the data.

Step 1: Data Preparation
First, let's load the data from the CSV files into pandas DataFrames and inspect them.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

## Load the datasets

ratings = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ratings.csv')
tags = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/tags.csv')
book_tags = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/book_tags.csv')
to_read = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/to_read.csv')
books = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/books.csv')

## Display the first few rows of each DataFrame to inspect the data

print("Ratings DataFrame:")
print(ratings.head(25))
print("\nTags DataFrame:")
print(tags.head(25))
print("\nBook Tags DataFrame:")
print(book_tags.head(25))
print("\nTo-Read DataFrame:")
print(to_read.head(25))
print("\nBooks DataFrame:")
print(books.head(25))
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After loading the data, we will perform some exploratory data analysis to understand the distributions and relationships in the data.

Step 3: Collaborative Filtering
We'll create a user-item matrix and use collaborative filtering to generate recommendations.

Step 4: Evaluation
We'll evaluate the recommendation system using appropriate metrics.

Step 5: Generate Recommendations
Finally, we'll generate book recommendations for users based on the trained model.

Let's start by executing the data preparation step. I'll load the data and inspect the first few rows of each DataFrame.
