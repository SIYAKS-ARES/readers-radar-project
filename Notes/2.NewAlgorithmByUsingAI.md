# Book Recommendations by AI

I want to enhance my collaborative filtering recommendation system by integrating an AI-based approach. Specifically, when a user requests a new book recommendation, program will:

1. Ask the user to provide a few books they have read and liked.
2. Use this input to generate personalized book recommendations based on the user's reading history and preferences.

Here's a step-by-step outline of how we can achieve this:

Step 1: Build the Collaborative Filtering Model
Prepare the User-Item Matrix: Ensure the user-item matrix is clean and properly formatted.
Train the Model: Use an algorithm like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to create a collaborative filtering model.

Step 2: Incorporate AI for Enhanced Recommendations
Collect User Input: Prompt the user to provide a few books they have read and liked.
Generate Feature Vectors: Create feature vectors for the user's preferences based on the provided books.
Use AI to Generate Recommendations: Use an AI model (e.g., a neural network) to generate personalized recommendations based on the user's feature vectors.

Step 3: Evaluate and Improve the Model
Evaluate the Model: Assess the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics.
Refine the Model: Iterate on the model by fine-tuning hyperparameters, incorporating additional features, and improving the algorithm's architecture.
Step-by-Step Implementation

Step 1: Build the Collaborative Filtering Model
First, let's assume we already have a user-item matrix from the previous steps.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from surprise import SVD, Dataset, Reader, accuracy
from surprise.model_selection import train_test_split as surprise_train_test_split

## Load the ratings dataset

ratings = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/ratings.csv')

## Prepare the data for Surprise

reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))
data = Dataset.load_from_df(ratings[['user_id', 'book_id', 'rating']], reader)

## Split the data into training and test sets

trainset, testset = surprise_train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2)

## Train the SVD model

algo = SVD()
algo.fit(trainset)

## Evaluate the model

predictions = algo.test(testset)
print("RMSE:", accuracy.rmse(predictions))
Step 2: Incorporate AI for Enhanced Recommendations
Collect User Input: Suppose the user provides a list of book IDs they have read and liked.

Generate Feature Vectors: Use the collaborative filtering model to generate feature vectors for these books.

Use AI to Generate Recommendations: Implement a neural network or another AI model to generate recommendations based on these feature vectors.

Here, I'll outline a simplified approach using a neural network:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

## Create a simple neural network model

class RecommenderNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_users, num_items, embedding_size=50):
        super(RecommenderNet, self).__init__()
        self.user_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_users, embedding_size)
        self.item_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_items, embedding_size)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(embedding_size, 1)

    def forward(self, user, item):
        user_embedding = self.user_embedding(user)
        item_embedding = self.item_embedding(item)
        x = user_embedding * item_embedding
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

## Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer

num_users = ratings['user_id'].nunique()
num_items = ratings['book_id'].nunique()
model = RecommenderNet(num_users, num_items)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

## Prepare the data for training

user_ids = torch.tensor(ratings['user_id'].values, dtype=torch.long)
item_ids = torch.tensor(ratings['book_id'].values, dtype=torch.long)
ratings = torch.tensor(ratings['rating'].values, dtype=torch.float)

## Train the neural network

for epoch in range(10):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(user_ids, item_ids).squeeze()
    loss = criterion(outputs, ratings)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

## Function to generate recommendations for a given user

def recommend_books(user_id, n_recommendations=10):
    user_tensor = torch.tensor([user_id] * num_items, dtype=torch.long)
    item_tensor = torch.tensor(range(num_items), dtype=torch.long)
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        predictions = model(user_tensor, item_tensor).squeeze()
    top_items = predictions.argsort[descending=True](:n_recommendations)
    return top_items.numpy()

## Collect user input (example)

user_input_books = [1, 2, 3]  # Example book IDs the user has read and liked

## Generate recommendations for the user

recommended_books = recommend_books(user_id=1)
print("Recommended Books:", recommended_books)
Step 3: Evaluate and Improve the Model
Evaluate the model using metrics like RMSE, MAE, precision, and recall. Iterate on the model by tuning hyperparameters, incorporating additional features, and improving the algorithm's architecture.

By integrating collaborative filtering with an AI-based approach, you can generate more personalized and accurate book recommendations for users based on their reading history and preferences.
